The best man throws the shindig and invites friends and relatives of the groom, usually male-only. The only caveats: The list shouldn't include 100 of the groom's closest friends, nor should it include people who don't get along.</p>

                    <h2>Think About It</h2>
                    
                    As best man, you're responsible for the groom, and the bachelor party is all about the groom. So, avoid any mishaps and use your head.
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure people don't drive home drunk: Hire a limo or car service for the night, have a designated driver, or make sure everyone takes a cab home. Bring along enough money to get everyone home safely.</li>
                        <li>Be sneaky if you want: Get together with the other groomsmen and come up with an ingenious plan to surprise the groom.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to the groom. Some people love to humiliate and tease the groom at the bachelor party; for example, they get him drunk, take incriminating photos of him, or shave off all his chest hair. Whether or not you get involved in these antics is entirely up to you, but when the groom says "Stop," it means stop.</li>
                        <li>Split costs equally between everyone attending the party (except the groom).</li>
                        <li>Be creative -- a night of carousing may seem like a good idea, but a weekend of white-water rafting may be more memorable in the long run.</li>
                        <li>Don't forget the camera.</li>
                    </ul>
